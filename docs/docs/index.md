## Tour Overview

The *BTP Tour* introduces BTP principles in form of a small sample scenario as illustrated in the [solution diagram](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/x/shl7H){target=\_blank} below. Over the course of the tour, we will not only establish an understanding of the various concepts, services, and relationships depicted in the solution diagram. We will also shed some light on how these artifacts surface to developers and cloud operators, and put all this in context with widely-cited cloud principles like
*observability*, *continous integration and deployment* (*CI/CD*), *infrastructure as code*, or *relentless automation*.
